-1 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september .
-1 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
+1 [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .
+1 the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic .
+1 remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .
+1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides .

+1 apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animé tradition and its defining philosophical conscience .
-1 like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .

-1 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .

+1 . . . an interesting slice of history .
+1 . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not .
+1 a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .
+1 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs .
+1 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike .
-1 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
-1 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .

-1 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
+1 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
-1 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly .
-1 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
-1 a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
+1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson .
+1 another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better .

+1 it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
+1 though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament .
-1 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
+1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere .
-1 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess .
+1 i simply can't recommend it enough .
-1 hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character .
-1 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
-1 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .
-1 wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway .
-1 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
-1 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
-1 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
+1 as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records .
-1 there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .

+1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family .
+1 demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking .
+1 " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see .
+1 with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis .
-1 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
-1 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
+1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
-1 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
-1 all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
-1 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .
-1 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
-1 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
-1 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
-1 holden caulfield did it better .
+1 this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun .
-1 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .
-1 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
-1 it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame .
-1 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
-1 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
-1 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
-1 ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
-1 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
-1 unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression .
+1 s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . .
+1 if you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need .
-1 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
-1 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
+1 [ferrera] has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .
+1 stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination .
-1 i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
-1 plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
+1 i liked this film a lot . . .
+1 is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .
+1 the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .
+1 manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time .
+1 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood .
-1 a thriller without a lot of thrills .
+1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true .
+1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many .
-1 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
-1 an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
-1 [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
+1 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity .
-1 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
+1 this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .
+1 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .
+1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .
-1 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
-1 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .

-1 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic .
-1 boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
+1 there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .
+1 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
+1 for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them .
+1 parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature .
-1 the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
-1 despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore .
-1 for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian .
+1 fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing .
-1 focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device .
-1 all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin .
+1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .
+1 the results , if not memorable , are at least interesting .
+1 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective .
+1 [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up .
+1 whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop .
-1 es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . .
+1 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior .
+1 [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form .
-1 the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention .
+1 a wonderful character-based comedy .
+1 if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone .
+1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale .
+1 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
-1 swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent .
-1 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
+1 blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .
-1 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
+1 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm .
+1 a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode .
-1 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide .
-1 releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .
-1 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
-1 it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
+1 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree .
-1 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
-1 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
+1 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .
+1 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band .
-1 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .
+1 the hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame .
+1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .
-1 outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken

-1 more trifle than triumph .
-1 it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does .

-1 the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .

-1 those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
+1 like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .

-1 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
-1 sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . .
+1 a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection .

-1 beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
+1 this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade .
-1 …passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .
-1 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ?
-1 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting .
+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .
+1 uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year .
+1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .
+1 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .

-1 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
+1 griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .
-1 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
+1 a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate .
-1 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
-1 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me .
-1 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
+1 a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .
+1 it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn .
-1 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .

+1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
-1 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
-1 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
-1 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .

+1 a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way .
-1 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
+1 a thought-provoking picture .
+1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius .

-1 it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
+1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .
+1 it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
-1 it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .

+1 twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone .
+1 funny and touching .
-1 go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
-1 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
+1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
+1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .
+1 reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies .
+1 most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds .
+1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .
+1 full of surprises .
-1 the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .
-1 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
-1 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation .
-1 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
-1 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products .
-1 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf .
+1 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately .
-1 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
-1 this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
-1 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
+1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing .
+1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community .
-1 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
+1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .
-1 a full-frontal attack on audience patience .
+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings .
-1 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick .
+1 an original little film about one young woman's education .
-1 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
+1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices .
+1 a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall .
+1 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
-1 if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
+1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected .
+1 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
-1 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
-1 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
+1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .
+1 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .
-1 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
+1 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie .
+1 sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
-1 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
+1 call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux .
+1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .
+1 beautifully produced .
+1 strange it is , but delightfully so .
+1 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .
+1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
+1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut .
+1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .
-1 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
-1 a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .
+1 gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .
+1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
-1 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
-1 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .
+1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid .
-1 phoned-in business as usual .
+1 with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy .
-1 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
+1 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat .
-1 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
+1 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
+1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama .
+1 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work .
+1 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological .
-1 a decidedly mixed bag .
+1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .
-1 a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
-1 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing .
-1 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
-1 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
-1 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
-1 yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence .
+1 you come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated .
+1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
+1 a well-executed spy-thriller .
+1 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .
-1 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
-1 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
+1 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
-1 amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . "
-1 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .
-1 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
+1 <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today .
-1 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
+1 it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
-1 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
+1 this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
+1 sweet and memorable film .
+1 with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path .
-1 a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
-1 most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
+1 the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining .
-1 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project !
-1 the thrill is ( long ) gone .
-1 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo .
+1 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .
-1 philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
+1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal .
-1 leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .
-1 deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
-1 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
-1 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
-1 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact .
+1 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street .
+1 who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ?
-1 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese .
+1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department .
+1 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out .
+1 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee .
-1 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
+1 children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
-1 . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
-1 as pedestrian as they come .
-1 for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
+1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
+1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .
+1 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat .
+1 the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal .
+1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them .
+1 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
+1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .
-1 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
-1 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
-1 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
-1 often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
+1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends .
-1 the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .
+1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want .
-1 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
+1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open .
+1 going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through .
+1 ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar .
-1 there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .

-1 this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often .
-1 murder by numbers just doesn't add up .
-1 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic .
-1 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
+1 you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear .
+1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .
+1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
-1 the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
-1 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
-1 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
-1 . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . .
-1 well , it does go on forever .
+1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market .
-1 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters .
-1 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
+1 droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . "
+1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work .
-1 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates .
+1 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .
-1 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
+1 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted .
-1 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered .
-1 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
-1 if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't .
+1 a joyous occasion
-1 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again .

+1 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
-1 in the end , there isn't much to it .
-1 directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name

+1 a compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother's hold over her .
-1 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .

+1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role .
+1 kinnear gives a tremendous performance .
-1 snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .
-1 it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making .

-1 was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?

-1 this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
+1 by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
-1 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .

-1 the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic .

+1 apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter .
-1 the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
-1 in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
+1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .
-1 the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
+1 if you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is .

+1 it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi .

-1 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress .
+1 don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . .
+1 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .

-1 there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .

-1 largely a for-fans artifact .
-1 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
+1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .

-1 not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were – i doubt it would be all that interesting .

-1 [it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
-1 all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .
+1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .

+1 the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill .
-1 . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
+1 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them .

+1 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten .
+1 though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .
+1 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .
-1 a major waste . . . generic .
+1 light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .

+1 it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart .
+1 even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying .
-1 instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
+1 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .

-1 witless and utterly pointless .
-1 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story .

+1 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection .
+1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .

-1 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
-1 sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
-1 john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .

+1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
-1 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
+1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do .
+1 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
+1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
-1 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
+1 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision .
-1 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
+1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
-1 rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical .
+1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .
+1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .

+1 an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings .
+1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
-1 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
+1 [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance !

-1 i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .

+1 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there .
+1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again .
-1 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
+1 . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .

+1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother .
-1 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
-1 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .

-1 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
-1 [l]ame and unnecessary .
-1 for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown .
-1 most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
-1 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived .
-1 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
-1 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
+1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .
-1 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
-1 the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
-1 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
+1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .
-1 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .
-1 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges .
+1 it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
+1 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth .
-1 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
-1 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .
-1 if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid .
-1 a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
+1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic .
+1 less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) .
+1 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy .
+1 there's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .
+1 kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
+1 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half .
-1 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .
+1 for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped .
+1 a film that will enthrall the whole family .
+1 part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .
-1 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay .
+1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .
+1 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .
-1 this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
-1 [a] mess .
+1 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
-1 goes on and on to the point of nausea .
-1 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
-1 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch .
-1 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare .
-1 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter .
-1 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon .
+1 . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle .
+1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
-1 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
+1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part .
-1 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow .
-1 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
-1 for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
+1 worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance .
+1 director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .
+1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .
+1 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie .
-1 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .
+1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner .
-1 there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
+1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .
+1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own .
+1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
-1 this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
-1 the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .
-1 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
+1 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema .
-1 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .
+1 genuinely unnerving .
+1 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez .
-1 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
+1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
-1 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
+1 goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .
-1 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
+1 . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking .
-1 whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
-1 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
+1 the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .
-1 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin .
-1 shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
-1 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
-1 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
-1 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? "
+1 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy .
+1 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .
+1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels .
+1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake .
-1 not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
-1 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
-1 this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
+1 as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice .
-1 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
+1 arguably the best script that besson has written in years .
+1 it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .
-1 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
-1 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
-1 stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career .
+1 stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 .
-1 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl .
+1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .
+1 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . .
+1 " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark .
+1 the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .
-1 " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store "
+1 noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
-1 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
-1 boy oh boy , it's a howler .
+1 . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway .
-1 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
+1 it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep .
-1 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
+1 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .
+1 it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds .
+1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics .
-1 . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
-1 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .
+1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .
-1 it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
+1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character .
+1 mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency .
-1 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .
+1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
-1 the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
+1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar .
-1 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
-1 while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
-1 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
+1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience .
+1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm .
+1 " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan .
+1 brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him .
-1 much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
-1 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
+1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture .
-1 uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
+1 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .
-1 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
+1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable .
-1 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
+1 . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps .
+1 allen's funniest and most likeable movie in years .
-1 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .
+1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims .
+1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority .
-1 the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
+1 a winning and wildly fascinating work .
-1 faultlessly professional but finally slight .
+1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce .
+1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .
-1 it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success .
-1 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .
+1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit .
+1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club .
+1 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna .
-1 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
-1 earnest but heavy-handed .
+1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history .
+1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men .
+1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent .
-1 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
-1 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
+1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts .
-1 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
+1 with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast .
-1 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
+1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies .
+1 a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .
-1 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story .
-1 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
+1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .
+1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .
+1 [a] satisfying niblet .
-1 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .
-1 unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't .
+1 schütte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close .
+1 a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility .
+1 fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .
-1 a feeble tootsie knockoff .
-1 fails to bring as much to the table .
+1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power .
+1 can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music
-1 both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told .
+1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .
+1 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
+1 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane .
-1 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore .
-1 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .
+1 gently humorous and touching .
+1 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .
+1 its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
+1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career .
+1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again .
-1 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
+1 dense , exhilarating documentary .
+1 for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions .
-1 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised .
-1 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
-1 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian .
+1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
-1 this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor .
+1 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy .
-1 a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes .
+1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .
+1 impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
-1 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
-1 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
-1 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial .
+1 you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit .
+1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
+1 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
+1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .
-1 a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground .
-1 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .
-1 hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
-1 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
+1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence .
-1 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .
+1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies .
-1 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks .
+1 it's a very valuable film . . .
-1 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .
-1 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess .
-1 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
-1 it's an awfully derivative story .
+1 hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .
-1 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
+1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
-1 despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
-1 this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
-1 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
+1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .
-1 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess .
+1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage .
-1 it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
+1 the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems .
+1 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world .
-1 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
+1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .
-1 anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
-1 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
+1 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .
-1 the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . .
-1 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .
-1 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .
+1 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .
-1 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
-1 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .
-1 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .
-1 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
-1 predictably melodramatic .
-1 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
+1 the performances are an absolute joy .
-1 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
+1 a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .
+1 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .
+1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say .
+1 the performances are remarkable .
-1 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work .
-1 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
-1 comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief .
+1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet .
-1 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
-1 shallow , noisy and pretentious .
-1 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .
+1 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time .
+1 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism .
-1 the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows .
+1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez .
+1 you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .
+1 one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace .
-1 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .
-1 the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
-1 all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat .
+1 pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .
+1 a slick , engrossing melodrama .
-1 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .
+1 from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .

-1 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one .
-1 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
+1 a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll .
-1 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
+1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred .
+1 trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease .
+1 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .
-1 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
+1 . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . .
+1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance .
-1 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot .
+1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
+1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults .
+1 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time .
+1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece .
-1 it bites hard .
+1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic .
-1 it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake .
-1 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz .
-1 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .
+1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share .
-1 . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
+1 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance .
-1 with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins .
+1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun .
+1 fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply .
-1 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
+1 a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . .
-1 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis .
-1 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it .
+1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .
-1 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard !
-1 'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
-1 la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
+1 a riveting story well told .
-1 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
-1 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
+1 there is greatness here .
-1 less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
+1 go see it and enjoy .
+1 from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in ‘warm water under a red bridge'
+1 an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy .
+1 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .
+1 this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .
-1 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
+1 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny .
-1 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament .
-1 movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ?
-1 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .
-1 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .
-1 it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense .

-1 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
-1 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
+1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact .
+1 " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .
+1 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness .
+1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride .
-1 don't waste your money .
+1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn .

-1 the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
+1 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
+1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
+1 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both .
-1 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
+1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .
-1 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .

+1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive .
+1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
-1 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
+1 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable .
-1 full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
-1 this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .

+1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary .
+1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
-1 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
-1 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
-1 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
-1 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .
+1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal .

-1 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
+1 originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .
-1 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .
-1 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too .
-1 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser .
-1 it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows .
+1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible .
-1 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
-1 we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
+1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic .
-1 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
+1 the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection .
-1 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess .
-1 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense .
-1 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
+1 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .
-1 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
-1 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
-1 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
+1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
+1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters .
-1 if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .
+1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies .
+1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time .
+1 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .
+1 the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .
-1 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .
-1 this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
+1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no .
-1 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
+1 while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own .
-1 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .
-1 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york .
+1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom .
-1 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .
-1 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
-1 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
-1 even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
+1 slight but enjoyable documentary .
+1 there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .
+1 mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .
-1 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
-1 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
+1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher .
-1 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
+1 a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .
+1 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .
-1 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
+1 . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . .
-1 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
+1 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters .
-1 full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
-1 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
-1 report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .
-1 appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites .
+1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .
-1 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
+1 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .
+1 the film is insightful about kissinger's background and history .
-1 this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
-1 two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
-1 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie .
-1 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
+1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness .
+1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful .
+1 japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime .
-1 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
+1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it .
+1 i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute .
-1 it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it .
-1 . . . has virtually no script at all . . .
-1 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
+1 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair .
-1 will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
+1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
-1 it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie—if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .
-1 . . . hokey art house pretension .
-1 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous .
-1 there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
-1 for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
-1 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem .
+1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .
+1 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent .
+1 feral and uncomfortable .
+1 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .
-1 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
+1 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time .
+1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
-1 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .
+1 . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
-1 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks .
-1 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
-1 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
-1 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either .
+1 much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .
-1 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .
+1 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem .
-1 doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
+1 like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .
+1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished .
-1 a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .

+1 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
+1 a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .

-1 with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
-1 'this movie sucks . '
-1 [at least] moore is a real charmer .
-1 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest .
-1 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
+1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
-1 feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
+1 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .
-1 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
+1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable .
+1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
-1 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
-1 too much power , not enough puff .
+1 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .
-1 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
-1 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
+1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
-1 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that .
-1 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .
-1 a dreadful live-action movie .
-1 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
+1 berry's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making " die another day " one of the most entertaining bonds in years
+1 . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal .
+1 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast .
+1 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily .
-1 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
-1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
+1 while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original .
+1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground .
-1 if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .
-1 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
-1 writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
-1 the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
+1 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
+1 dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . "
+1 it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
-1 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .
-1 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention .
-1 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it .
-1 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .
+1 the formula is familiar but enjoyable .
+1 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry .
+1 highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .
+1 the film has several strong performances .
-1 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
+1 exciting and well-paced .
+1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
-1 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
-1 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
+1 director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films .
+1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .
-1 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
+1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
+1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america .
-1 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
-1 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
-1 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
+1 the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
+1 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
-1 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie .
-1 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
-1 execrable .
-1 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
-1 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
+1 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .
-1 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash .
-1 it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future .
+1 despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity .
-1 . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
-1 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
+1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario .
+1 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .
+1 both damning and damned compelling .

+1 [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it .

-1 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '

+1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .
-1 tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .
-1 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else .
+1 lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .

-1 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless .
-1 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
-1 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
+1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties .
-1 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
+1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
+1 rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy .

+1 in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players .
-1 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .
-1 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
+1 one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .
+1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .
-1 the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
+1 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .

-1 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .
+1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen .
+1 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .
-1 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
+1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character .
-1 everything is off .
-1 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .
-1 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
+1 a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film .
-1 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
+1 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .

+1 what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .
+1 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .
-1 it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .

+1 has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
-1 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better .
+1 this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .
-1 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .

-1 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
+1 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns .
-1 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway .
+1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance .
-1 it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original .
+1 the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears .
-1 made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .

+1 " the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble .
+1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor .
-1 i'm just too bored to care .
-1 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one .

+1 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal .
-1 a negligible british comedy .
-1 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg .
-1 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
-1 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
-1 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
+1 this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary !
-1 . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
-1 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .

-1 [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .

+1 mais um momento inspirado de david fincher .
+1 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is .

+1 not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one .
-1 amazingly lame .
-1 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
+1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice .
+1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .
-1 the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .
-1 it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental .
+1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed .
-1 the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
-1 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .

-1 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
-1 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal

+1 'almodóvar logra un filme entrañable , lleno de compasión , comprensión , amor , amistad , esperanza y humanidad que es sencillamente inolvidable . '
-1 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .
-1 . . . one resurrection too many .
-1 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
+1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution .
-1 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
-1 we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
+1 cool ? this movie is a snow emergency .
-1 i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down .
+1 an escapist confection that's pure entertainment .
-1 it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
-1 like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
-1 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times .

+1 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
-1 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
+1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together .
+1 a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .
+1 sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .
-1 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
-1 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
+1 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering .
+1 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda .
+1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion .
-1 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
-1 i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
+1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .
+1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .
+1 one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him .
-1 eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal .
-1 meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making .

+1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .
+1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .
-1 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché .
+1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism .
-1 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
-1 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
+1 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .
-1 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .

+1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time .

+1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami .
-1 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .
+1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances .
+1 in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .
+1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .
+1 what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you .
+1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .
+1 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake .
+1 much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever .
-1 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .

+1 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
+1 goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational !

+1 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined .
+1 you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit .
+1 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness .

+1 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .
-1 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company .
+1 this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty .
+1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .

-1 fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
-1 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .
+1 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters .

-1 it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style .

-1 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .

-1 a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .

-1 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .

+1 y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt .

-1 the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
-1 an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving .

+1 imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy .

+1 old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment .
-1 even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .
-1 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .
+1 the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less .

+1 the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians .
+1 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis .
-1 i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .

-1 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .

+1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair .
-1 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
-1 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
+1 between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism .
+1 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .

-1 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
-1 it's not original enough .
-1 the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .

+1 payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human .
+1 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place .
+1 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .

+1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life .

-1 where the film falters is in its tone .
+1 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand .

+1 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie .
+1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners .

-1 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little .

+1 it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on .
+1 [næs] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage .

-1 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless .
+1 . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original .

-1 even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash .
-1 puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face .
-1 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well .
+1 audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in amélie .

+1 it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight .

+1 nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun .

-1 what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .

-1 the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made .
-1 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion .
+1 it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .
-1 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down .

-1 the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense .
+1 it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more .

+1 the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .
+1 the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of .

-1 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
+1 roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie .

-1 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows .
+1 even better than the first one !

+1 . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint .
-1 if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .
+1 conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown .
-1 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .

-1 wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
+1 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films .

+1 charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie .
