# ---------------------
# Maintain and update a belief distribution over the probability of a car
# being in a tile using exact updates (correct, but slow times).

    # Function: Observe
    # -----------------
    # Updates beliefs based on the distance observation and your agents position.
    # The noisyDistance is a gaussian distribution with mean of the true distance
    # and std = Const.SONAR_STD. The variable agentX is the x location of
    # your car (not the one you are tracking) and agentY is your y location.

    # ---------------------
    # Update your inference to handle the passing of one heartbeat. Use the
    # transition probability you created in Learner

    # ---------------------
    # Returns your belief of the probability that the car is in each tile. Your
    # belief probabilities should sum to 1.
