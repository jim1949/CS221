# ---------------
# This class is in charge of observing cars drive around and figuring out a
# probability distribution over transitions that cars make.

    # Function: Note Car Mode
    # ----------------------
    # This function is called once for each car on every heart beat of the
    # program. OldPos was the old position of the car and newPos is the position
    # of the car after the heartbeat. The code provided takes these positions
    # and extracts the corresponding tiles. Update any relevant variables with
    # this new datapoint.

    # algorithms.
